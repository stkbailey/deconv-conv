# Deconvoluting convolutions: A case study in image analysis
For the uninitiated, image analysis can be daunting, especially when it comes to deep learning. In this talk, we'll use Kaggle's 2018 Data Science Bowl as a case study in image analysis. Even if you've never worked with an image array before, you'll walk away with some foundational tools for image analysis and an understanding of how some common deep learning models perform so well. 

### About the speaker
Stephen Bailey is currently an NIH Fellow at Vanderbilt University, using magnetic resonance imaging to understand how education changes brain structure and function.
