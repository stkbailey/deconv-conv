# Deconvoluting convolutions
"Convolution neural network" is basically synonymous with "confusing complex system", so if you're new to the field, you might be a little overwhelmed. Fortunately, you're not alone! In this talk, I'll introduce the fundamentals of using deep learning for analyzing images in the context of the 2018 Data Science Bowl, a national competition to improve the detection of cell nuclei in microscope images. We'll start from scratch and work our way up to the strategies the top competitors used to win the Kaggle competition. 

### Talk outline
1. Why are convolutions convoluted?
  * What do we do with image data
  * What image data is
  * What image data is not
2. The old approach
  * Thresholding
  * Filters
  * Connected components
3. The new approach
  * Neural networks
  * Convolutional layers
  * U-nets
4. The really new approach
  * Object detection
5. Take-aways
